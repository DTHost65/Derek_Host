    "text": "Welcome to my website!\nHello My name is Derek Host.\nMy research interests are currently in cystic fibrosis intestine, particularly in the altered glycolsysis that we see. I started at University at Buffalo (UB) obtaining a bachlors in computational biology and bioinformatics with a minor in computer science. During my undergratuate study I performed student research with Dr. Ram Samudrala from 2022-2024 where I developed pipelines within CANDO to predict compound toxicity. In 2024 I moved to Case Western Reserve University where I am now in Dr. Drumm’s lab where I focus on altered metabolism, glycolysis in particular, within varios parts of the Cystic Fibrosis mouse small intestine.\nDuring my time at UB I was also able to TA for a class called Discrete Mathmatics for my computer science minor, during this role I had many responsabilities such as proctoring exams and grading asssignments but more importantly leading office hours and leading my own weekly recitation. I developed many skills leading these sessions throughout the semesters such as how to more effectively convey ideas and general communication skills. During the Fall semester of 2024 at Case Western Reserve University I worked with a high school student and a undergraduate student on projects related to cystic fibrosis. Currently these are ongoing but an learing valuable skills in the meantime.\nIf you would like to talk about my research or collaberate relating to anything you see here please feel free to contact me."

CF is linked to altered carbohydrate and lipid metabolism with transcriptomic data showing glycolysis is upregulated in the jejunum and ileum, but not in organoids derived from crypt cells (laboratory data), suggesting the involvement of in vivo-specific signals. This crypt vs. organoid difference points to endocrine or paracrine signals (e.g., hormones, cytokines) stimulating glycolysis in vivo.\nI will analyze upregulated genes from transcriptomic data to identify potential transcription factors driving increased glycolysis. Using bioinformatics tools, I’ll list possible factors, and then refine this list through literature searches. Based on gene expression derived from bulk RNA seq data and the literature search I’m focusing on Hif1a and Nrf2. Understanding their signaling pathways will help explain the dysregulated metabolism in CF intestines. Because Nrf2 is known to be dysfunctional in other organs with CF I hypothesize that dysregulation of Nrf2 due to nonfunctional Cftr leads to increased oxidative stress, which activates Hif1a and drives glycolysis.\n\nUpregulated glycolysis genes by sample type alongside known Hif1a targets.

Pipelines typically comprehensively compute interactions between all compounds and all proteins in corresponding libraries, resulting in a compound-proteome interaction signature to describe compound behavior/function. The interaction signatures are compared to each other in an all-against-all fashion and ranked similarity lists are produced. Our hypothesis is that compounds with similar interaction signatures behave/function similarly, and therefore may be associated with the same indication/phenotype. Performance is assessed based on the recovery rate of known drug-indication mappings being recaptured within particular cutoffs in the ranked similarity lists. Compounds within the top ranked cutoffs that are not known mappings are treated as novel predictions for a given indication/phenotype.\nOur toxicity prediction pipeline comprises a compound library of 389 small molecules whose median lethal dose (LD50) values after normalizing to mg/kg fell within a range of 1 to 8800 mg/kg, and a protein library of 64 proteins. Each compound was assigned one of twenty phenotypes representing varying toxicity levels. The pipeline was then run as described above using an in-house similarity-based interaction scoring protocol and four performance evaluation metrics were calculated: average phenotype accuracy, average pairwise accuracy, phenotype coverage, and normalized discounted cumulative gain at the top10 cutoff. The average phenotype accuracy of 43.7% represents compounds accurately recaptured within specific cutoffs for a phenotype; the average pairwise accuracy (44%) is a weighted average based on the number of compounds associated with the phenotype; the phenotype coverage is the number of phenotypes with nonzero accuracy (20); and the normalized discounted cumulative gain (0.054) evaluates the ranking quality of predicted compounds per phenotype. In comparison, random controls produced values of 40.4%, 42.2%, 20, and 0.045 respectively for these metrics, demonstrating the improved predictive power of our approach. This study demonstrates the capability of CANDO for accurate small molecule toxicity prediction, which has the potential to improve drug discovery efficiency. Future work will involve regenerating these results with better phenotype classification and using the complete human proteome library, which we expect to generate a larger difference between control and observed values.\n\nFigure showing flowchart of project development from library creation to benchmarking."

    "text": "I am currently working on submitting two grants described below, talk about some stuff for a few sentences.\nTitle - Altered Glycolysis in Cystic Fibrosis Mice Small Intestine\nNIDDK - F31\nMetabolism of fats and carbohydrates is altered in cystic fibrosis (CF), but the etiology is not clear. Much emphasis has been placed on lipid metabolism, but carbohydrate and protein metabolism are much less well characterized. Carbohydrate metabolism is particularly complicated because most persons with CF will develop diabetes as they age, but the energy imbalance in CF is present throughout life.\nMouse models of CF do not appear to develop diabetes, but we find that circulating glucose levels are reduced in CF mice relative to WT animals, providing an opportunity to study altered metabolism without the complications of diabetes.\nGlucose is available to the body through the ingestion of carbohydrates, gluconeogenesis, or glycogenolysis of liver and muscle glycogen, all of which will supply the blood with glucose to be carried to peripheral tissues. We find that hepatic glycogen in CF mice is similar to WT mice after feeding and glycogenolysis appears to be similar across genotypes as well. To monitor and compare the fate of glucose in CF and WT animals, regardless of its origin, mice were injected by tail vein with a radioactively labeled analog of glucose, 18 FDG, to bypass absorption and gluconeogenesis allowing glucose originating from a single source to be traced through the body. PET-MRI and CT- MRI of 18 FDG showed that there is a more rapid uptake by CF than WT animals of glucose from the circulation to the gut. As 18 FDG is not metabolized, the fate of glucose (glycolysis, excretion, etc.) could not be determined.\nTranscriptome analyses of small intestines, their crypts, and organoids derived from the crypts, suggest glycolysis is increased in CF intestines and crypts, but not organoids. Measurements of intestinal tissue glycolysis indicate that glycolysis is, in fact, elevated in CF intestines, but why the difference is observed in crypts, but not organoids, is not clear.\n\n\nTitle - Hif1a activaton in the cystic fibrosis small intestine\nCFF - Student Trainee Award\nI will begin by performing Western Blots using protein samples collected from intestinal tissue as well as samples from organoids in order to see if the transcriptional upregulation translates to an increase in the stabilized HIF-1α subunit. I would expect to see increased levels of HIF-1α in the intestinal tissue compared to the organoids\nThe next test would be to look at the localization of HIF-1α within the cell, if HIF-1α isn't degraded then it is translocated into the nucleus where it dimerizes with the HIF-1β subunit to begin to act as a transcription factor. If we can see an increase in protein levels via the western blot we can then perform immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence techniques to visualize the localization of HIF-1α within the cell, expecting to see localization within the nucleus, a DAPI counterstain would be used to visualize the nuclear space.\n\nOnce confirmed that HIF-1α displays increased protein levels in the intestine but not the organoids as well as the HIF-1α being localized to the nucleus where it begins acting as a transcription factor I can perform ChIP-seq then followed by ATAC to further understand the specific genes that HIF-1α is able to act as a transcription factor for as well as chromatin availability differences between the samples. ChIP-seq is an important experiment to determine where in the genome the HIF complex binds to acting as a transcription factor, then I can work back to understand what genes those regions are associated with and then what potential pathways could be affected. This would give me a specific set of genes that the HIF complex acts on in a CF-specific environment which we can then match to specific pathways that it may upregulate such as glycolysis. This could be followed by ATAC seq to look for differences in chromatin availability between these samples to understand how the specific environments may impact and alter the downstream effects of the HIF complex transcription factor."
